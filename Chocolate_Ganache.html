    <h4>This is a rich, dark chocolate topping or decoration that has lots of uses. It can be whipped as filling or
        icing, or just poured over whatever cake you like.</h4>

        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>Place the chocolate into a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small sauce pan over medium heat. Bring just
                to a
                boil, watching very carefully because if it boils for a few seconds, it will boil out of the pot. When
                the
                cream
                has come to a boil, pour over the chopped chocolate, and whisk until smooth. Stir in the rum if desired.
            </p>

            </p>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
            </li>
            </p>
            <p>Allow the ganache to cool slightly before pouring over a cake. Start at the center of the cake and work
                outward.
                For a fluffy frosting or chocolate filling, allow it to cool until thick, then whip with a whisk until
                light
                and
                fluffy.</p>
        </ol>
