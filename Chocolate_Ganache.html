    <h1>Chocolate Ganache</h1>
    <p><img src="recipes/image.jpeg" alt="Recipes pictures"></p>
    <p>
    <h4>This is a rich, dark chocolate topping or decoration that has lots of uses. It can be whipped as filling or
        icing, or just poured over whatever cake you like.</h4>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <p>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>Place the chocolate into a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small sauce pan over medium heat. Bring just to a
            boil, watching very carefully because if it boils for a few seconds, it will boil out of the pot. When the
            cream
            has come to a boil, pour over the chopped chocolate, and whisk until smooth. Stir in the rum if desired.</p>
        <p>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>Allow the ganache to cool slightly before pouring over a cake. Start at the center of the cake and work
            outward.
            For a fluffy frosting or chocolate filling, allow it to cool until thick, then whip with a whisk until light
            and
            fluffy.</p>
        <p>
    </ol>
